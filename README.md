# Chris C. and Will Z. Battleship

### *Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.*

  * Our design process for iteration three involved a good amount of trial and error, as things needed to be tested almost exclusively in the CLI as opposed to having a full suite of RSpec tests. 
  * However, we did refer back to our work on Flashcards in order to take some inspiration from the runner file there, as well as to see how things were set up in the game class. That was helpful

### *If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?*
  * That's a good question! Honestly, we feel pretty satisfied with the current state of the game in terms of bugs we've been able to catch and fix, in addition to the polishing we've done to make it feel smoother. Still, there's always room for improvement, and it would be fun to look into some iteration four ideas such as increasing the size of the board, adding more ships, and perhaps adding some ASCII art.

  ### *Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.*
  * We began with driver-navigator pairing, but then evolved a bit from there. We knew that with one partner in Alaska and the other in Massachusetts, doing everything synchronously would not be the best use of our time. Also, one partner was sick over the weekend, and so the other did some solo work until everyone was feeling better. Once we were back together, we continued to mix it up with both synchronous pairing and solo work, which seemed to work well for us (and allowed for more practice with actual PRs when doing things solo).

  ### *Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.*
  * Feedback was shared in a variety of ways. During synchronous pair work, feedback was generally given live and in-person, though in constructive ways. PRs also provided ample opportunity for feedback, as individual comments could be left on lines of code (in addition to overall thoughts on the whole PR).
